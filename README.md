# Peak_detection

This is a small python notebook where I train a machine learning model to detect peaks in a two-peak gaussian function and from that find distance between those peaks.

Here, I have tried both regression and classification approaches.

Although both approches gives good results. From the error histograms, the regression approach seems to work better.

This comes to show how machine learning can be applied to pick up patterns in a time series data.

## What's next ? 
Now, I will implement the same thing in 2 dimensions and 3 dimenstions and observe how model complexity( time and space ) changes with increasing the dimensions.

# Peak_detection

This is a small python notebook where I train a machine learning model to detect peaks in a two-peak gaussian function and from that find distance between those peaks.

Here, I have tried both regression and classification approaches. 

Although both approches gives good results. From the error histograms, the regression approach seems to work better.
